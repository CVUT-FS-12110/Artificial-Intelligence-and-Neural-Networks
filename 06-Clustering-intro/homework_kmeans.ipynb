    "# Homework: Image Compression using K-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will apply the K-means clustering algorithm for image compression. The goal is to reduce the number of colors in an image by clustering similar colors together. This is a practical application of K-means in the field of image processing and computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the K-means clustering part of the image compression function. You are provided with a template where the image loading and preparation steps are done. Your task is to complete the `compress_image` function by implementing the K-means algorithm to find the main color clusters and then map each pixel of the image to the nearest cluster centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand and implement K-means clustering.\n",
    "- Apply K-means for color quantization in images.\n",
    "- Analyze the effect of different numbers of clusters on the image quality and compression.\n"
